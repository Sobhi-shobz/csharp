# 📝 To-Do List App (C# Console Project)

## 📖 Description
A simple console-based To-Do List app that lets you:
- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Remove tasks

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Uses a **List<string>** to store tasks.
- Uses **methods** for each operation (Add, View, Remove).
- Demonstrates **loops**, **methods**, and **classes**.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating and using methods
- Handling lists and loops
- Organizing code into readable structure
